# Node Audio Stream

Small server to allow streaming of soundcard to an express endpoint. Only tested on elementaryOS (0.4.1 Loki), I needed to have Pulse Audio Volume control running in order to capture audio from my soundcard or it wouldn't work. Feel free to try out on Windows/macOS.

`node index.js`
